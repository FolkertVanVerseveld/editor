File editor tools

For my hobby projects, it is essential to have a good file editor that
manipulates arbitrary large files that is fast, robust and stable. The
alternatives I've looked at had multiple problems that caused me to write this
one myself:

- preallocation of whole file in memory
- unable to handle multiple number formats properly
- fast file resizing

The plain demo has a provided help that illustrates how to use the builtin
commands. It provides error-checking, but some commands don't strictly check for
correctness, which means you can append garbage and it will still consider it as
a valid command. E.g.: `t 10 wut'
